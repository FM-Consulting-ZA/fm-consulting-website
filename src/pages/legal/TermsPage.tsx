          These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of{' '}
          <strong>{legalEntity.website}</strong> (the “Site”). The Site is operated by{' '}
          <strong>{legalEntity.name}</strong>, a private company registered in South Africa under registration

          The Site tells you about FM Consulting, our services and our published thinking. It lets you contact us,
          request a consultation and subscribe to our insights. It does not sell goods or services online, and no
          consulting agreement is formed through it.
        </P>
        <Callout>
          Any engagement with FM Consulting is governed only by a written proposal, engagement letter or services
          agreement signed by both parties. If that agreement conflicts with these Terms, the agreement prevails.
        </Callout>
        <P>
          Sending an enquiry or booking a consultation does not create a client relationship, and it does not oblige
          either of us to proceed.

          indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss, or for any loss of profit, revenue, data or goodwill,
